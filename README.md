# Hello All

I am a Data Analyst with over 2 years of experience in the fields of data science, analytics, consulting and machine learning. My professional journey has taken me to renowned companies like Deloitte and Wolters Kluwer, where I've had the privilege of working with cross-functional teams and diverse clients. I hold a Master's degree in Business Analytics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Gies College of Business where I achieved academic excellence recognition for scoring a perfect GPA in the first semester.

During my tenure at Deloitte, I was an integral part of the consulting team as an analyst, collaborating with clients and stakeholders spanning across the US and UK. I also had the opportunity to intern with Wolters Kluwer in their Advanced Analytics team, further enhancing my expertise.

My skill set encompasses a wide range of data-related tasks, including data extraction, database modeling, data mining, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and dashboard creation. I am well-versed in machine learning and artificial intelligence where I worked with a multitude of algorithms and techniques to effectively obtain business insights. I am proficient in various tools and technologies including Python, SQL, Javascript, R, SAS, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Knime Power BI, and Tableau. Additionally, I possess hands-on experience with cloud technologies like Google Cloud, AWS, and Data Bricks.

I am a dedicated individual with a strong passion for analytics. I believe in transforming businesses through data-driven decision-making and the fact that advanced analytics can advance efficiency and performance and shape businesses. I am committed to advancing my career by applying my strong analytical and communication skills to the analytics domain. I aspire to explore roles as a Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Data Scientist where I believe I can make an impact.
